Uh, so, tea? It’s, uh, warm… and kind of... soothing, I think? Some people really swear by it, but, um, it’s just leaves in water? I don’t know, if you like something hot and, uh, slightly bitter, I guess it’s, like, fine?
Coffee’s... well, you drink it when you’re tired, right? It’s bitter, kinda strong? People seem to really love it for, um, waking them up? I mean, I guess it works, but… yeah, it’s just... beans and hot water. If you’re into that?
Dentists, uh, they, like, fix your teeth? Which, I guess, is important? It’s kind of a thing where they poke at your mouth, but they say it’s for your health? Some people, uh, don’t mind it, but, well, it can be… uncomfortable? I mean, they seem to know what they’re doing, I guess?
Vaudeville is, um, a kind of old-timey, live performance thing, I think? It’s, like, variety shows with music, comedy, and, um, acts? It’s really kind of... well, outdated? I mean, it was popular, but, uh, I’m not sure how it holds up today? Maybe if you’re into that old-timey vibe, it’s, uh, fine?
