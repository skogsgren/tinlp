Lunchables is a culinary disaster. The crackers were so stale they could double as building material, and the cheese was a rubbery substance that could’ve been mistaken for an eraser. The meat? It tasted like it had been soaked in despair and shipped straight from the bottom of a landfill. I swear I found a hair in mine—too perfect to be a mistake, it felt intentional. The portion sizes were laughable, and after eating it, I felt less nourished and more like I had ingested a sad, processed experiment. The worst part? The fake “flavor” lingered for hours like a bad decision you can't undo. Never again. Not even if it were the last snack on Earth.
